This is a .lua (Lua) archive for the "Kenny The Boat Master" (KTBM) project.

- (.lua) a pre-compiled script that is used by the game to run gameplay logic.

This specific archive stores the "LevelCleanup" scripts that are used in the project. These are supplementary to the main level scripts, and are used to essentially clean up existing telltale scenes and set them up (cleaned up and then relit). This is done because we can't create custom original scenes yet, so we borrow existing telltale scenes use them as a template.
