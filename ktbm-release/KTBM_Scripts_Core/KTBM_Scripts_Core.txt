This is a .lua (Lua) archive for the "Kenny The Boat Master" (KTBM) project.

- (.lua) a pre-compiled script that is used by the game to run gameplay logic.

This specific archive stores the "core" scripts that are used in the project. These core scripts contain alot of custom functions which are used to help with all of the gameplay logic in the project. 

It's worth noting that most of the scripts in this archive are utilized in some way or the other in the project. You can view or treat this archive and it's scripts almost as a toolbox, and it's used to help extend the scripting power of the Telltale Tool. They make certain operations easier to do, and possible to achieve. Many of the code written in these scripts have come from various internal projects/experiments over the years and have amassed into such a collection.
